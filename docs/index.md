# Welcome to the Rāpoi HPC documentation!

The Rāpoi HPC (High Performance Computing) system, also known as Raapoi, is a computing resource provided by Te Herenga Waka that allows you to run large and complex computing tasks. The cluster uses the Slurm resource manager to schedule jobs and allocate resources, such as CPU, memory, and time, to each job. It's important to carefully consider how much of these resources you need for your job, as requesting too little can result in your job terminating prematurely or running slowly, while requesting too much may unnecessarily delay the execution of other jobs.

Rāpoi consists of different partitions, each of which is a group of compute nodes with a specific hardware configuration. The partition you use for your job will depend on the type of work or task you want to submit.

To customize your computing environment, Rāpoi uses the module system, which allows you to easily access the applications and programming languages you need.

In this documentation, you will find all the information you need to get started with running jobs on the Rāpoi HPC Cluster. If you need more help, check out the [training](training.md) tutorials, which provide step-by-step instructions for popular applications and languages, or the [examples](examples.md) section for simpler examples.

If you notice any errors or outdated information in the documentation, please don't hesitate to create an [issue](https://github.com/vuw-research-computing/raapoi-docs/issues) on the [documentation github page](https://github.com/vuw-research-computing/raapoi-docs) or submit a pull request to improve the documentation.
