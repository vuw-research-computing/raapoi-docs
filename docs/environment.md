# Enviroment Setup

Rāpoi has an extensive library of applications and software available. There are numerous programming languages and libraries (R, Julia, Python, lua, OpenMPI, blas, etc) as well as dozens of applications (Matlab, Gaussian, etc).  We also keep older versions of software to ensure compatibility.

Because of this, Rāpoi developers use a tool called *lmod* to allow a user to load a specific version of an application, language or library and start using it for their work. The _module_ command will show you what software is available to load, and will add the software to your environment for immediate use. 

Entering `module help` into the command prompt will give you some basic information about all of the `module` sub-commands. 
Here we briefly describe the most important ones.

## Searching for software packages

This section will give you a brief description on how to find which software packages are available and load them.

### Searching with `module avail`

To show all software available to load type the following:

  `module avail`

This is a long list of software packages which can each be loaded immediately (i.e. without first loading pre-requisites).
Generally each software package is listed as a path of the form *<software name>/<version number>*, eg. _lua/5.3.5_.
The list is separated into a few sections (via lines of dashes).
The section of most interest has the heading 
```
----------------------- /home/software/tools/eb_modulefiles/all/Core -----------------------
```
The modules under this heading (or similar) are from the new module system (see [New Module System](new_mod.md) for more extensive details).

In contrast, the modules listed under the heading
```
----------------------------- /home/software/tools/modulefiles -----------------------------
```
are from the old module system. 
Beware that many of these older software packages in this section may no longer work.

There may be other sections, depending on what modules you already have loaded.
For example, if `GCC/10.3.0` is loaded then you will see the additional sections
```
--------------- /home/software/tools/eb_modulefiles/all/Compiler/GCC/10.3.0 ----------------
   Bio-SearchIO-hmmer/1.7.3    FlexiBLAS/3.0.4    GSL/2.7          OpenBLAS/0.3.15    Subread/2.0.3
   Boost/1.76.0                GEOS/3.9.1         Haploflow/1.0    OpenMPI/4.1.1

------------- /home/software/tools/eb_modulefiles/all/Compiler/GCCcore/10.3.0 --------------
   Autoconf/2.71           (D)    Python/3.9.5                (D)    libevent/2.1.12
   Automake/1.16.3                Qhull/2020.2                       libfabric/1.12.1
   Autotools/20210128             RE2/2022-02-01                     libffi/3.3
   BLIS/0.8.1                     RapidJSON/1.1.0                    libgeotiff/1.6.0
   Bazel/3.7.2                    Rust/1.52.1                        libgit2/1.1.0
<etc. many more lines...>
```
These sections show various additional modules for which `GCC/10.3.0` is a pre-requisite.
Many pieces of software have one or more pre-requisites in the new module system.
A more convenient way to search for specific pieces of software, and determine what their pre-requisite modules are, is via the `module spider` command.

### Searching with `module spider`

Suppose you want to find out which Python versions are available, you can search via the command `module spider Python`, for example:

```bash
username@raapoi-login:~$ module spider Python

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Python:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Description:
      Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively.

     Versions:
        Python/2.7.15-bare
        Python/2.7.15
        Python/2.7.16
        Python/2.7.18
<additional output not included here>
```
Note that the capital **P** in `Python` is important here. 
Capital **P** `Python` modules/packages are generally from the new module system, whereas lower case `python` modules/packages are older (and may no longer work).
The same goes for many several other software packages such as `R` 
(versus `r`) and `OpenMPI` (versus `openmpi`).

Among the list of Python versions is `Python/3.9.6`.
To find out how to load it we call `module spider` again with the specific Python version included, e.g.
```bash
username@raapoi-login:~$ module spider Python/3.9.6

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Python: Python/3.9.6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Description:
      Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively.


    You will need to load all module(s) on any one of the lines below before the "Python/3.9.6" module is available to load.

      GCCcore/11.2.0
      
<additional output not included here>
```

## Loading software packages

Loading a software package is done via the command `module load <package name>` where *<package name>* should generally include the version as well.

For example, the output of `module spider Python/3.9.6` (from above) tells us that in order to load this version of Python we must first load `GCCcore/11.2.0`. 
That is, we can load this version of Python via
```bash
username@raapoi-login:~$ module load GCCcore/11.2.0
username@raapoi-login:~$ module load Python/3.9.6
```
If we wanted to ensure we had a clean/minimal software environment, we could start with a purge (see below for details), that is 
```bash
username@raapoi-login:~$ module purge
username@raapoi-login:~$ module load config GCCcore/11.2.0
username@raapoi-login:~$ module load Python/3.9.6
```
In either case, you will now be able to run Python version 3.9.6 by entering `python` at the command prompt.
If you are intending to do some computation, you should call `srun --pty python` to start an interactive job on the quicktest node running Python.



## Other useful module sub-commands


### Listing loaded modules

To see what modules you have loaded into your environment you can run the command:

`module list`  

By default you will have the config module loaded (which makes the *vuw-* commands available) and possibly several others. 
For example, here are the modules I have loaded in my environment when I login:

```bash
username@raapoi-login:~$ module list

Currently Loaded Modules:
  1) autotools   3) gnu9/9.4.0    5) ucx/1.11.2         7) openmpi4/4.1.1   9) config
  2) prun/2.2    4) hwloc/2.7.2   6) libfabric/1.13.0   8) ohpc

```

You can also check if a specific module is loaded via the command `module is-loaded <package name>`.


### The `module whatis` and `module show` commands

If you want to know more about a particular module you can use the _whatis_ or
_show_ subcommand.  
The output of _module whatis_ will be more details for some modules than others. 
Here is one example:

```bash
username@raapoi-login:~$ module whatis foss/2020b
foss/2020b          : Description: GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) based compiler toolchain, including
 OpenMPI for MPI support, OpenBLAS (BLAS and LAPACK support), FFTW and ScaLAPACK.
foss/2020b          : Homepage: https://easybuild.readthedocs.io/en/master/Common-toolchains.html#foss-toolchain
foss/2020b          : URL: https://easybuild.readthedocs.io/en/master/Common-toolchains.html#foss-toolchain
```

The output of _module show_ shows the help information associated with the module/package as well as various steps which are executed when the module is loaded.

```bash
username@raapoi-login:~$ module show GCC/10.3.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   /home/software/tools/eb_modulefiles/all/Core/GCC/10.3.0.lua:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
help([[
Description
===========
The GNU Compiler Collection includes front ends for C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Java, and Ada,
 as well as libraries for these languages (libstdc++, libgcj,...).

]])
whatis("Description: The GNU Compiler Collection includes front ends for C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Java, and Ada,
 as well as libraries for these languages (libstdc++, libgcj,...).")
whatis("Homepage: https://gcc.gnu.org/")
whatis("URL: https://gcc.gnu.org/")
conflict("GCC")
load("GCCcore/10.3.0")
load("binutils/2.36.1")
prepend_path("MODULEPATH","/home/software/tools/eb_modulefiles/all/Compiler/GCC/10.3.0")
setenv("EBROOTGCC","/home/software/EasyBuild/software/GCCcore/10.3.0")
setenv("EBVERSIONGCC","10.3.0")
setenv("EBDEVELGCC","/home/software/EasyBuild/software/GCC/10.3.0/easybuild/Core-GCC-10.3.0-easybuild-devel")
```

Note that both the _whatis_ and _show_ commands will only work if you have loaded the pre-requisites of the module/package you are looking up.


### The `module keyword` command

Using `module keyword` is another way to search through the module system.
Specifically, `module keyword blah` will search through help messages and whatis descriptions to find any mention of `blah`.
For example, if you know you want to do a search for `lua`, you can find lua packages and any packages which mention lua in their help/whatis via keyword subcommand:

  `module keyword lua`


### Clearing/purging your environment

The command `module purge` will unload all of your modules.
This can be quite useful to do as a first step before loading modules.
It can help ensure you don't accidentally end up with conflicting versions of any modules (which generally gets taken care of by lmod, but can sometimes be an issue), and can help you work out a *minimal* environment that works for your desired software.

If you execute `module purge` you will lose access to the *vuw-* commands, but you can reload them via `module load config`.

Individual modules/packages can also be unloaded via `module unload <package name>`.
