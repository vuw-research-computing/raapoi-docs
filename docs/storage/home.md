### Home Directory Tips

Home directories have a small quota and are on fairly slow storage.  The data here is **backed up**.  It is replicated off site live as well as periodically backed up to off site tape.  In theory data here is fairly safe, even in a catastophic event it should be recoverable eventually.

If you accidentally delete something here it can be recovered with a service desk request.

While this storage is not performant, is is quite safe and is a good place for you scripts and code to live.  Your data sets can also be on your home if they fit and the performance doesn't cause you any problems.

For bigger or faster storage see the [Scratch](scratch.md) page.
